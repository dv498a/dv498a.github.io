## அறிமுகம்

IPC 498A வழக்கின் கீழ் பொய் வழக்கு ஒரு ஆணின் குடும்ப நபர்கள் மீது பதியப் பெற்றால் Section IPC 498A பற்றியும் அதற்கு அடுத்து என்ன செய்வது என்றே குடும்ப நபர்களுக்குத் தெரிவது இல்லை. இந்த அறிமுகமானது இப்படி பொய் வழக்கின் கீழ் கொண்டு செல்லப்பட்ட குடும்ப நபர்கள் எப்படி நிலைத்து நின்று பொய் வழக்கை எதிர் கொள்வது என்பது பற்றிய கட்டுரையே இது.

This document is divided into three chapters  The first chapter gives you an overview and attempts to educate you about your rights and some applicable laws
 The second chapter gives you an idea about what you can expect to face
once you get caught up in the Indian criminal justice system
 The third chapter details what you can do to fight this
menace and also gives you some general information

- முதலில் என்ன என்ன உங்களுக்கு உள்ளது. என்ன என்ன உரிமைகள் உள்ளன? உரிமைகள் பற்றி பேசும் சட்டங்கள் என்ன என்ன?
- இரண்டாவது Indian criminal justice system கீழ் கைது செய்யப் பெற்றால், எவ்வகையான இன்னல்களை எதிர் கொள்ள நேரிடும்!
- மூன்றாவது இந்த 

This document should be read on a computer connected to the Internet, due to the numerous links to websites that
are embedded in the document
 However, most of the content and supporting material is summarized here

There are two classes of Indian citizens, the privileged and the ordinary
 The privileged will never get into a situation
like this, as the laws don’t apply to them
 The Arjun Singh 498A case is a prime example
 Though he is an accused in
a criminal case, he is still a Union Minister whereas thousands of govt employees have lost their jobs or find
themselves under suspension due to an unsubstantiated allegation

This document is meant for the not so privileged, the law-abiding citizens who have no idea about what it means to
get entangled in a criminal case on the basis of an allegation

Man or woman, regardless of age or marital status, if you have welcomed a nasty or a stupid `Bahu’ (daughter in law)
into your family, whether she is living/lived/never lived with you; you can be jailed under Section 498A of the IPC,
based on her complaint in the police station
 The objective of the ‘Bahu’ and her parents is to subject you and your
family to an ordeal designed to break your will and ensure that you give in to their demands
 This law targets families
who belong to the middle and upper middle classes of society and NRIs, as these segments of society are vulnerable to
legalized extortion by corrupt agencies of the government

There is no way to avoid a 498A from being filed, unless you are very well connected or somehow manage to make her
realize that it is not in her long term interest to do so
 However, you will win if you choose to fight
 A typical case will
go on for 3 to 7 years

Be prepared to lose some of your most productive years professionally
 Be prepared to lose your hair
 Be prepared to
spend money and lots of it
 Be prepared to shed a lot of tears
 Above all, be prepared to watch your parents and
siblings suffer, all on account of the abuse of this idiotic law

To fight a 498A, you will need patience, courage, knowledge about the laws, your fundamental rights, information
about how others have fought their cases, a clear idea about what they want from you, and you need to develop the
ability to think like a crook
 Things become easier of you are well connected/develop connections with the
bureaucracy
 Patience and the ability to think clearly and unemotionally are the most important qualities needed

If you are innocent, you will eventually prevail
 I assure you of this

If you apprehend being 498A’d, don’t just stand there like a deer caught in the headlights
 From the people you talk
to and from the online portals you visit, you will learn that this is a criminal law to combat domestic violence and
dowry harassment etc, etc, etc
 I’ll ignore this and cut to the chase

In its present form,
